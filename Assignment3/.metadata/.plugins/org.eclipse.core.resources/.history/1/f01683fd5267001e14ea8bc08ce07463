//Q1. (Credit Limit Calculator)
//Develop a Java application that determines whether any of several department-store customers has
//exceeded the credit limit on a charge account.
//For each customer,the following facts are available:
//a) account number
//b) balance at the beginning of the month
//c) total of all items charged by the customer this month
//d) total of all credits applied to the customer’s account this month
//e) allowed credit limit.
//The program should input all these facts as integers, calculate the new balance (= beginning
//balance+ charges – credits), display the new balance and determine whether the new balance
//exceeds the customer’s credit limit. For those customers whose credit limit is exceeded, the
//program should display the message "Credit limit exceeded".
